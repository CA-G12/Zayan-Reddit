## 👤 User journey
- When the user opens the website from his browser for the first time, he will get the main page of the website which contains all the posts and two buttons for signing in or up at the header.
- If you haven't registered before, click the **Sign up** button, then you will get the sign-up page. Fill out the form and hit **Sign up** and the end of it.
- If you already have an account, click the **Sign in** button, then you will get the sign-in page. Fill out the form and hit **Sign in** and the end of it.
- After signing successfully, the journey starts. The user will get the main page again.
- Take a look at the header(nav-bar): 
**- Reddit logo:** once clicking, you will get the main page always.
**- Search bar:** isn't working till now.
**- Create post:** once clicking, you will get the create post page where you can add your post.
**- Username:** once hovering or clicking, a drop-down menu with two options will appear: ***View profile*** and ***logout***

- In the body of the main page, an input field appears at the top, when you click you will be taken to the create post page.
- Under the create post input field, you can see all the posts.
- Each post has a **Comments** button at the bottom of it. Click to get the Post page and all comments on it. You can add your comment too, by typing it on the input field on the Post page and clicking the **+ Add my comment** button and it will appear at the top!
- In the Create post page: you will have two buttons at the top: **Text content** and **Image**. At least you should add text content, the image is optional. Add your text in the text content on the input field. If you want to add an image, click the **Image(optional)** tab and enter the URL in the input that appears. You can view the image added once by clicking the **Preview image** button. I have image URL validation so don't try to add a random URL hhhh! Finally, hit **Add post** when you are done!
- Any user you can see through the main page in the posts, comments, and Post page, click on his avatar to view his profile. On the profile page, you check how many posts he/she has and all his/her posts.
